# Glaucoma_detection
Checking the accuracy of various classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM using a Glaucoma dataset.

The dataset used here is Glaucoma.csv

It consists of patients medical data and history.

The primary focus of this project is not accuracy of glaucoma classification, but how different classification models classify the same problem.
